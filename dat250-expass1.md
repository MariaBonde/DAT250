##Report on software tests

I had some issues with downloading the various software, 
but using homebrew for both maven and postgres worked wonderfully

For java, maven and git I checked my version in the terminal 
to confirm that I did indeed have it downloaded. 

I also had some issues with the version control and pushing 
to git. I did not have an SSH key in github, but as soon 
as I made that I could push my own repository. I also had some 
issues pushing my the java-getting-started to my own github.
