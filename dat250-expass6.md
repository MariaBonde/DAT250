### Report on expass 6
In this assignment I started out with the serving-web-content
tutorial as a base. Then I followed this tutorial: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-angular-web
to do the assignment. A lot of the html, especially for the 
form component, is copied from this tutorial. Following this
went pretty smoothly, I had to rewrite my todos-assignment to
springboot as it was in spark, but I think the practise
was good. I initially wanted both the form and the list in 
the same page as the picture in the assignment text, but 
I could not figure it out, and since the functionality was there, 
I decided it was good enough.
Here is the github link. To run it, just  run the ServingWebContentApplication
and then cd into AngularClient and write ng serve --open in the terminal.
