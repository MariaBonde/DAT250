#### Assignment 4 report
Experiment 1 went pretty smoothly after I had 
downloaded Postman desktop, and it was helpful 
to understand how to do experiment 2. In experiment
2 I did have some trouble realizing how to 
exactly write requests so that I passed the tests,
but they were quite helpful in discovering what 
problems may arise, and creating solutions for them.
