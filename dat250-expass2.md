## Report on assignment 2
I started with experiment 1, but it was not clear what was ready 
in the tutorial and what needed to be done. As a result, I created a 
new persistence.xml, which made things difficult. This took a while 
to figure out, but with some help it went fine after that. 

I struggled a lot with the database and that it would not run, but it 
did work after a while. I had mininterpreted where the database ended 
up, which complicated things. Implementing the methods, relationships 
and creating the database in itself went smoothly I felt. 

I used the diagram and queries to inspect that everything was working 
with the database. I also ran the test case of course.


Here is a picture of my database
